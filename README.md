# RAG-Gaming-PC-Recommender-System
Goals of Project

To help users find the best Gaming PC within their budget.

To allow users to search using natural language queries like “Recommend me RTX 3060 gaming PC under 1.3 lakhs”.

To build an AI-powered recommender system that gives personalized results quickly.

Process

Collected & cleaned dataset of gaming PCs and their specifications (CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage, Price, etc.).

Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Python to handle natural language queries.

Integrated with Django backend for handling user requests.

Designed a frontend UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the system interactive and user-friendly.

Connected backend and frontend using REST API so results update dynamically.

Features of the Project

Users can type free-text queries (like “gaming PC with RTX 3080 under 1 lakh”).

Budget filtering in INR (not CAD).

Displays multiple PC recommendations with name, specs, and price.

Simple & clean search interface for a professional look.
